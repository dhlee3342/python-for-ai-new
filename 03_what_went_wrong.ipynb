    "1. With the rapid development of AI frameworks that support coding AI methods, it is common that functions are renamed, moved, or replaced or inputs changed. In most cases, the developers will warn you that this is happening in the future and start issuing what are called **deprecation** warnings--something that is deprecated is being phased out and will, at some point, stop working. Take note of these warnings, especially if you are developing code you hope to use for a while. Making the change to the new name/function/way of calling the feature now may save you trouble in the future. But, despite the warning, the function will still work for now.\n",
    "\n",

Use ax.get_subplotspec().rowspan.start instead.\" This means that the `rowNum` parameter is being phased out and will not be supported after Matplotlib 3.4 (two minor versions later).

    "\n",
    "![CUDA out of memory error](images/CUDA_OOM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When things don't work well, the error can be more cryptic and hard to understand what went wrong. \n",

    "> CUDA is the programming language the interfaces with the GPU. The Python libraries that we use work behind the scenes to communicate with CUDA so you don't need to worry about it much. But when you see CUDA, know that means something to do with a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of the issue is that because there is time spent in moving data from the CPU memory (the computer's main RAM chips) to the GPU memory (the much more limited RAM built into the GPU itself), Python tries to minimize data movement. While notebooks are fairly good at managing the memory within a single notebook, a notebook will try to keep its memory on the GPU and not let other notebooks make use of the GPU RAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you have multiple notebooks open in a session, it is common to have odd errors caused by out-of-memory (OOM) situations. In many cases, Python recognizes and reports the error, but in some cases, hard to diagnose errors are displayed. In general, especially in our course notebooks, when you get an error, especially one using the GPU, suspect that there may be an out-of-memory error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, use the \"Running Terminals and Kernels\" panel and stop the kernels for notebooks you are not using. In this screenshot, there are several running notebooks:\n",
